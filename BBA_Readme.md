Detailed Information about BBA Emulation.

Nintendont supports BBA Emulation in the following titles:  
Mario Kart: Double Dash!!  
Kirby Air Ride  
1080 Avalanche  
PSO Episode 1&2  
PSO Episode III  
Homeland    

It works just like a real BBA and works from both a USB LAN adapter and over WLAN.  

To enable BBA Emulation, simply go into nintendonts settings and enable it.  
If you are on a Wii, you can also switch the Network Profile as configued in your Wii Settings used for it.  
This can be useful if the profile cannot be selected as a default in the Wii Settings when it has no internet access and you just need LAN acccess.  
On WiiU this option is not available, but it is not needed because you can default a profile regardless of internet access or not.      


Game specific notes:  
For Mario Kart, Kirby Air Ride and 1080 Avalance, when you want to connect to a real GameCube or Dolphin, first go into the LAN Mode on them.  
After THEY start looking for other consoles, only THEN connect the other nintendont instances.  
If you do not follow that order, nintendont will not be able to see the other consoles, possibly due to a bug in the wii firmware.  
Important for PAL users: Both Mario Kart and 1080 Avalanche have to be set to the same 50/60Hz setting on all consoles on game boot in order to be found by other consoles, if one of your consoles is set to a different refresh rate, it wont be detected by the others when they search.  
Interestingly, this does not apply for Kirby Air Ride which will find each other and work regardless of your 50/60Hz selection.  
You can only connect to other consoles in your local network unless you use a LAN tunneling program such as Xlink Kai just like on a real BBA.  
Also, while WLAN will work, it of course has the potential to run slower.  
Note that 1080 Avalanche has a especially big problem with disconnecting very often, see helper cheats below to help its connection.    

For the Phantasy Star Online games you are able to connect to private servers such as schthack after creating an account on them.  
After making an account, go into the games network settings, set DHCP to auto and do not disconnect, and then enter the DNS Server of the private server you want to join.  
You can also connect a USB Keyboard and use it ingame when you have native controls turned off without any further setup required.  
With native controls turned on it will instead accept a real GameCube Keyboard in the controller port of original Wiis if you happen to own one.  
The keyboard layout will be for a japanese keyboard by default, see helper cheats below if you want to use a different layout.    

For Homeland, you can use the game as both server and client when you enable the direct IP mode in game. Just set its network settings to DHCP auto just like PSO.  
Then you should be able to play with it just like on a real GameCube or Dolphin.      


Helper Cheats:  
Below you can find various cheats for 1080 Avalanche and the Phantasy Star Online games.  
You can convert those to a .gct file using this website: https://geckocodes.org/index.php?gct=  
Simply add the codes, edit the PSO ones as required, download the .gct and put it named as "game.gct" next to your "game.iso" on whatever device you have your games on.  
Of course, make sure to enable cheats in nintendonts settings so they have an effect.
